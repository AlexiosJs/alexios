# Alexios

[æŸ¥çœ‹ä¸­æ–‡ç‰ˆ](./README_zh-cn.md)

## Why

Alexios is a cli that allows you to `quickly start` a React project with the minimum cost, almost `zero configuration`. Based on `Webpack 4` and `Babel 7`, it solves the problem that create-react-app cannot be customized.

## Docs

- [CHANGE_LOG](./CHANGELOG.md)

## Features

- ðŸŒŸ Out of the box, zero configuration to start.
- ðŸŒŸ Contained `dev`, `build` and `watch` commands, support babel, css-modules, mock, hmr, etc.
- ðŸŒŸ JSON mode configuration, keeps the API of webpack to the greatest extent, exposing that JS interface that can meet the additional expansion needs.
- ðŸŒŸ Friendly graphical console and error information.

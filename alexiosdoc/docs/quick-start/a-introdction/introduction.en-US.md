# <strong>Introduction</strong>

## <strong>Development Intention</strong>

The purpose is to develop a Launcher + Packager which configuration are extremely simple, Nextjs-like and no need to learn a lot of APIs and configuration. Friendly for beginners. Do not make any changes to the existing project structure, do not force the use of any business attributes, and do not change the development mode. Automate everything that users don’t want to care about and have no time to care about. Just focus on the business code.

## <strong>Features</strong>

- 🗳️ Started with zero or very few configurations, meeting more than 80% of enterprise-level development needs. Automatic first, reduce costs and stay focused.
- 🚄 Multi-core compilation, shorten compilation time by more than 50%, give development and production the same experience, and make development more efficient.
- 🤖 Automatic packaging strategy, js lazy loading, reuse of resources, compatible with privatized deployment, and maximum use of cache.
- 📟 The JSON-like mock data structure supports custom mock logic, hot swapping intercepts interface requests.
- 📝 CSS Modules that support css, less, sass, scss, and stylus are automatically enabled according to the import method without configuration.
- 🧱 Based on react-app-polyfill, only one configuration is required, and it can be quickly compatible with IE9, and quickly opened with the command line.
- 👕 TypeScript supported.

## <strong>Environment</strong>

- Node version > 8.6.0

## <strong>Future</strong>

- 🤩 webpack@5.
- 🤩 Enabling physical cache, speeding up the second start.
- 🤩 Built-in optional functional plugins.
- 🤩 Websocket Mock.

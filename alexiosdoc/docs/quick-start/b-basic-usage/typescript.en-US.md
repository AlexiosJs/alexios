# <strong>TypeScript</strong>

## <strong>Coding With TS</strong>

By default, runtime compilation of <strong>.ts</strong>, <strong>.tsx</strong> is supported, and no configuration is required.

## <strong>Runtime Lint</strong>

We just compile the ts code into js, and temporarily do not provide code inspection at runtime. If necessary, it is recommended to use editor to cooperate with `tsconfig.json`.

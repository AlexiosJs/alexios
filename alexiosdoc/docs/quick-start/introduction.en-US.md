## Development Intention

The purpose is to develop a <b>Launcher + Packager</b> which configuration item is extremely concise, <b>Nextjs-like</b>, and without a large number of APIs and configuration documents to slow down the development progress，let the beginners get started in an instant. Don’t want to make any changes to the existing project structure, but just change a way to launch. <b>No business attributes are mandatory</b>. The user does <b>not have to adapt to a new development model because of a launcher</b>, because a good idea may not be suitable for everyone. It's best to <b>automate</b> everything that users don't want to care about and have no time to care about. You only need to pay attention to your business, and let him do the rest.

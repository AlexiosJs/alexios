# TypeScript

## Coding With TS

By default, runtime compilation of `.ts`, `.tsx` is supported, and no configuration is required.

## Runtime Lint

We just compile the ts code into js, and temporarily do not provide code inspection at runtime. If necessary, it is recommended to use editor to cooperate with `tsconfig.json`.
